    <h2 class="bg-success">About Me</h2>
    <p>I was born in Oregon, where I also live now, but grew up moving between here, California, and Texas. When we lived in Oregon during my childhood, my dad worked for Intel, and I always admired the fact that I grew up around someone who worked with sophisticated technology. However, only recently have I decided to follow in his footsteps and make a career out of it. For many years, I struggled in math and science classes in school, so I thought it would not be a good fit for me. Nevertheless, I have discovered that I can be good at anything I put my mind to, and as I have grown up, things that did not make sense to me before are starting to now.</p>
